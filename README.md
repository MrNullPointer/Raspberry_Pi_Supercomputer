# Raspberry Pi Supercomputer

In this project, we present our work on a Raspberry Pi cluster consisting of four nodes. The advantage of using a cluster over a single board system is the improvement in efficiency as well as the computation power. A single Raspberry Pi is used for minimal computations. However, when multiple of Pi's are configured together, they coherently form an energy-efficient cluster that can be used for enhanced processing of data by using the distributed and parallel computing methodologies. Here we present the critical steps on creating a cluster, how the system is set-up, and the hardware-software configurations. We will also discuss the potential uses of our cluster, the case around which our project is wrapped discusses the implementation and benchmarking of matrix-multiplication using our developed cluster.
